- Added ckeditor with upload plugin configured to use fileman PHP file manager (installed in Apache).
Still showing error message: "Error: Permission denied to access property 'CKEDITOR'" because ckeditor is running in Tomcat
and fileman is running in Apache. Anyway the upload works and to place an image in the ckeditor is just a matter of getting
the link and place in the image.
